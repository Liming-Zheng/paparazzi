you need some version control system as well as the kernel headers

 apt-get install mercurial linux-headers-$(uname -r) mplayer

get the source (use v4l-dvb-kernel-experimental for kernel > 2.6.20)

 hg clone http://mcentral.de/hg/~mrec/v4l-dvb-kernel

copy over the em28xx* files from the cvs and build v4l-dvb

 cd v4l-dvb-kernel
 make
 sudo make install 

copy em28xx to /etc/modprobe.d as the Pollin USB-R1 does not have an EEPROM
for auto detect (Typhoon DVD Maker works without). watch video in the gcs
with (maybe adjust the NORM)

 mplayer tv:// -tv driver=v4l2:width=320:height=240:norm=NTSC:input=0:device=/dev/video0:noaudio -ao noalsa -nolirc -nomouseinput -really-quiet

or build spook and use it to distribute through rtsp

 cd spook
 make

as the v4l-dvb-kernel updates some parts of the video4linux interface, just
building wis does not work. if you want to use the Plextor M402U you have to
use a patched (this is evil) Module.symvers. Either use the one provided or
copy the symbol hashes over from the *.mod.c files. generate the headers

 cd v4l-dvb-kernel
 sudo make kernel-headers

then build wis-go7007
