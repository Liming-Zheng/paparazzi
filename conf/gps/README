This are the settings that we use for the ublox SAM-LS unit. You can use u-center on a Windows box ( available upon registration from ublox website )

- use the Tools/GPS Configuration menu to open a window
- check 'Store configuration into BBR/Flash' box to permanently save it in the receiver
- select the file and click File->GPS

Or use the ublox_conf.c application to do it :)
